# 2x2_solver
AI project/experiment for solving a 2x2 puzzle cube

When running the proj.ipynb Jupyter Notebook file, enter moves one at a time to turn the cube.  
Moves can be upper or lower case, and can contain an optional modifier at the end to denote degrees turned.

Possible moves are: R, U, F, L, D, B (Right, Up, Front, Left, Down, Back) for face turns, and X, Y, Z for cube rotations along the corresponding axes.  
Each of these moves can be performed 90° clockwise, 90° counter-clockwise or 180° 'double' moves.  

A scramble can be generated by entering 'scramble'.  This scramble performs 10 random R, U and F moves, with no same-face moves occuring consecutively.
