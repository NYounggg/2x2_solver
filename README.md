# 2x2_solver
AI project/experiment for solving a 2x2 puzzle cube

When running the notebook file, enter moves to turn the cube.  Possible moves are: R, U, F, L, D, B for face turns, and X, Y, Z for cube rotations.  
Each of these moves can be done clockwise (r), counter-clockwise (r') or double moves (r2).  

A scramble is generated when you run the code, following a vaguely WCA-complient scrambling algorithm.
